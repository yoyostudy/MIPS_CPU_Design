# MIPS_CPU_Design
A stepwise and complete design of pipeline MIPS CPU, subject to CSC3050@CUHKsz

This is a record of the course assignment and project I have done for the course CSC3050 Computer Architecture.

Basically, this course is composed of four projects:
1. Realize MIPS assembler using Python
2. Realize MIPS simulator using Python (**)
3. Achieve MIPS ALU using Verilog
4. Realize pipelined CPU using verilog (***)

Project 2 is the difficult as it involve syscall

Project 4 require a through understanding the workflow and datapath of the CPU. The bonus point is also difficult to get.
